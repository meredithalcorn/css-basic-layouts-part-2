CONTROLLING LAYOUTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------

POSITIONING ELEMENTS SIDE BY SIDE WITH INLINE DISPLAY

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Remember, it is best to display mobile layouts as on column layouts because of the narrow viewport.

Every element is a rectangular box that is either block level (that stack on top of each other and aren't side by side on the same line.), or in line elements.  A browser displays block elements them as a single block of content with a break before and after it.

In line elements like images links and span tags do not create line breaks in a layout.  They appear on the same line as the elements and content beside them.

For the navigation bar, the parent container will be the header which is a block.  h1, li, and a tags are all block elements within the navigation bar (<header class="main-header">) As block elements, they each take up an entire line and stretch the full width available to the left and the right.


WE WILL NOW LEARN HOW TO CHANGE THE DEFAULT BEHAVIORS OF ELEMENTS.

We will change the site name and navigation to display horizontally on wider screens only by using the media query.
  *Change the display property for the .name and .main nav li elements to "in-line"

--To place the navigation on the same line as the name element we have to change the unordered list display to in-line as well.  Even though the li items are set to in-line the ul class "main-nav" is a block element.  It will drop below that block element.

--When an element is set to in-line, the browser will not apply any width and height properties, or top and bottom margin settings.  It only accepts the padding-left and padding-right and margin-left and margin-right properties.  The same goes for texts in paragraphs.  In-line elements naturally flow next to each other.

  *To add space between the clickable links in our navigation bar, we will target .name a, and .main-nav a to have a padding of 15px;

USING INLINE-BLOCK to SET WIDTH, HEIGHT, TOP, AND BOTTOM MARGIN AND PADDING

--Generates an element that is like a block element but flows with its surroundings as if it is an in-line element.
  -You can style an inline-block item as you would a block level element with width, height, and top bottom margins while keeping it on the same line as the elements beside it.
  -Change the navigation name and items to be display: inline-block;
    * Now we can use the margin, width, and height properties.

  -The main-nav elements wrap to the next line when browser collapses.  This all because we have used the inline-block property, and it is its default behavior.  We could have adjusted this using a media query.

  -- For our main-nav element, we will make the hover target taller and wider so it's easier to tap on touch screen devices.
    * By setting the link display value to block, it will make them as wide as their parent elements (this is a bit confusing to me).  Now the full width and height of the links are clickable areas.
    * The links will take on the top and bottom padding values - height expands by 20 pixels because the top and bottom padding was set to 10px.
