CONTROLLING LAYOUTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------

POSITIONING ELEMENTS SIDE BY SIDE WITH INLINE DISPLAY

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Remember, it is best to display mobile layouts as on column layouts because of the narrow viewport.

Every element is a rectangular box that is either block level (that stack on top of each other and aren't side by side on the same line.), or in line elements.  A browser displays block elements them as a single block of content with a break before and after it.

In line elements like images links and span tags do not create line breaks in a layout.  They appear on the same line as the elements and content beside them.

For the navigation bar, the parent container will be the header which is a block.  h1, li, and a tags are all block elements within the navigation bar (<header class="main-header">) As block elements, they each take up an entire line and stretch the full width available to the left and the right.


WE WILL NOW LEARN HOW TO CHANGE THE DEFAULT BEHAVIORS OF ELEMENTS.

We will change the site name and navigation to display horizontally on wider screens only using the media query.

--Change the display property for the .name and .main nav li elements to "in-line"
